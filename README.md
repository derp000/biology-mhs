# Magnet BioMentor

Built with React and Firebase using Typescript, Tailwind, and Vite.

# Purpose

Magnet BioMentor was created as a study tool for Dr. Gupta's Freshman-year Biology course. Magnet freshmen may find Biology daunting at first but incredibly rewarding in the end; in fact, many motivated freshmen have gotten 5's on the AP Biology test based on the freshman-year content alone. In other words, Dr. Gupta's class will ultimately prepare Magnet students for the rigor and styles of teaching found in college. However, it's necessary for freshmen to learn how to adapt to the elevated course rigor, which many may struggle to do at the beginning of the year. Magnet BioMentor aims to facilitate this transition.

# Features

Two key goals for Magnet BioMentor are Accessibility and Self-Sufficiency.

## Accessibility

Magnet BioMentor follows the same chapters/curriculum as taught in Dr. Gupta's class. Within each chapter, you will find resources ranging from lecture slides to videos and worksheet PDFs. These resources originate from Freshman/AP Biology Google Classroom posts and videos I personally found beneficial. This way, students do not need to search through Classroom posts themselves and can readily use helpful study materials.

## Self-Sufficiency

Each chapter also comes with quiz questions curated from [Freshman Biology Quizzes](https://highered.mheducation.com/sites/0072919345/student_view0/chapter1/multiple_choice_quiz.html) and [AP Biology Quizzes](https://media.pearsoncmg.com/bc/bc_campbell_biology_11/msa/content/practice-test/app/). These hand-picked questions place emphasis on key concepts and critical thinking. Incorrectly-answered questions are tied to the user's Google account, enabling customized review. The Advice page also provides insight into effective learning/study techniques.
